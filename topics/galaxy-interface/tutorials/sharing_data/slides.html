## Three ways to Share Data in Galaxy

- You can share everything you do in Galaxy. From histories, to workflows, and even visualizations
  1. Share with individual users by using a Galaxy account's email addresses on the same instance
  2. Share data using a weblink, which can be accessed by anyone with it.
  3. Share and publish data on the shared data menu.

### 4. To share your history with individual users via email.
  - Click the **Share History with Individual Users** dropdown on the **Share or Publish** screen.
  - Enter the email address you wish to share to in the **Please specify user email** input box and click on save. If the email is not a registered galaxy user, you would get this prompt.

### 5. Not a valid Galaxy user? You can share data using a weblink. This way anyone with the link can view it.
  - In the **Share or Publish** screen, switch the **Make History accessible** toggle on.
  - Click the copy icon to copy the link.
  - Whats more? You can also edit the last part of your link. Cool right?

### 6. You can now publish your History
  - In the **Share or Publish** screen, switch the **Make History publicly available in Published Histories** toggle on.
  - Nice!
  
  Here is something to note though: You cannot publish your data, without first creating a sharable web link for it.
